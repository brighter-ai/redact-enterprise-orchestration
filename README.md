This repo contains a docker-compose file and scripts for running REDACT in an enterprise/on-premise environment.

Until now the customers have to run the separate docker containers themselves as [described here](https://docs.brighter.ai/docs/running-brighter-redact-enterprise-three-container-mode).

# Running redact enterprise

- Make sure you have a valid license file in the same folder as the scripts, named `license.bal`
- Run `start_redact.sh``
